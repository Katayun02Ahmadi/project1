		This is <b>Katayun Ahmadi</b> daughter of Mohammad Dawood. I was born in Pakistan and grew up there.  My educational journey started from <i>New Milleneum high school</i> in Pakistan. I was ten when a new chapter of my life began.
		<br>
		At age of ten I lost my father, therefor we moved back to Afghanistan. I continued my education in <i>Mirwali high school</i> in Mazar_e_Sharif. We lived in Mazar_e_Sharif for four years. We then moved to Kabul and started a new life.
		<br>
		Moving to Kabul, I joined <i>Qala_e_Bakhtyar high school</i>. After five years, I graduated from the mentioned school by obtaining A grade. I took Kankor examination and succeeded in <strong>Software engineering</strong> department of Computer Science faculty of Kabul university by getting 314 points. But, it was the time Taliban took control over the country, thus, I could not continue my education.
		<br>
		There is a famous quote by Bob Marley that says:<br>
		<q><strong>Love the life you live. Live the life you love</strong></q><br>
		This sentence has a significant impact on my life. It is our life. No one has any right to interfere in it. live your life as you want. Never think about what people say. Be the one you want to be. Morover, be thankful of what you have.<br>
		Actually, I want everyone know about this and always remember that nothing is important than your happiness, nothing at all.<br>
		This is what I have learned from life.<br>
		'Life goes on'. So live it happily.
